forensics investigation methodology. The financial forensics is used to combines the criminal
investigation skills with financial auditing skills and it is used to identify the criminal
financial activity coming from within the selected organization. It is used to utilize the
accounting, auditing, and investigative skills to analyse the organization financial statements
for possible fraud in connection with ongoing legal action. A digital forensic investigation is
used to investigate the data which could be taken from the computer hard disk or any other
storage devices*
